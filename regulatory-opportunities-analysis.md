## 💡 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### Option A: "Regulatory Compliance Suite" (Most Ambitious)
Build a unified platform covering multiple regulations with shared infrastructure:

```
Platform: "ComplianceHub EU" or "RegReady"
├── CBAM Module (launch Q1 2026 — URGENT)
├── DPP Module (launch Q3 2026)
├── CRA Module (launch Q1 2027)
├── EUDR Module (optional, if capacity)
└── Shared: Customer portal, supplier data collection, reporting engine
```

**Economics:**
- 10 engineers × 12 months = MVP of 2-3 modules
- Target: 500 customers by end 2026
- Average €5k/year = €2.5M ARR
- At 10x revenue multiple = €25M valuation potential

### Option B: "CBAM First, Then Expand" (Fastest to Revenue)
Go all-in on CBAM (deadline is NOW), then expand:

```
Phase 1 (Q1 2026): CBAM MVP launch
Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Iterate, acquire 100+ customers  
Phase 3 (Q3-Q4 2026): Add DPP module (battery deadline panic)
Phase 4 (2027): Add CRA module
```

**Why This Works:**
- CBAM deadline creates immediate demand
- Steel/aluminum/cement = your domain from Heijmans
- Revenue from CBAM funds DPP development
- Same customer base (manufacturers) buys multiple modules

### Option C: "EPD Disruptor" (Leverages Your Expertise Most)
If you want to stay closest to construction:

```
Build: "EPD Express" — 10x cheaper than One Click LCA
Target: Dutch/EU construction materials SMEs
Integrate: BIM workflows, Revit, IFC
Price: €500-1,500 per EPD (vs €5-20k competitors)
```

**Why:**
- One Click LCA has near-monopoly but charges enterprise prices
- AI can automate 80% of LCA work
- Your BIM background is a massive advantage
- Natural path to DPP (EPD data feeds into DPP)

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

Given your resources (10+ engineers, sales capacity, construction background):

### **Go with Option B: CBAM First**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Deadline is NOW** — Jan 1, 2026 is 7 days away
2. **Your domain** — Steel, aluminum, cement are core construction materials you know from Heijmans
3. **Clear requirements** — EU has published exact calculation methods (Annex III)
4. **SME market is desperate** — Greenly/CarbonChain are enterprise-only
5. **High urgency = faster sales cycles** — Companies MUST comply or face penalties
6. **Natural expansion** — Same customers will need DPP, same data infrastructure

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **This week:** Talk to 5 Dutch steel/aluminum importers about CBAM pain points
2. **January:** Build MVP (CN code classifier + emissions calculator + report generator)
3. **February:** Launch to first 20 beta customers
4. **March:** Iterate, add features, start charging
5. **Q2:** Scale sales, add DPP module planning
6. **Q3:** Launch DPP for batteries

**Team Allocation (10 engineers):**
- 4 engineers: CBAM core platform
- 2 engineers: Supplier data collection portal
- 2 engineers: Integrations (customs, accounting software)
- 2 engineers: Infrastructure, security, ops

**Sales Focus:**
- Dutch importers first (your network)
- Customs brokers as channel partners
- Trade associations (Metaalunie, FME, Bouwend Nederland)

## Financial Projections

### CBAM Platform — First 18 Months

| Metric | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 | Q3 2026 | Q4 2026 | Q1 2027 | Q2 2027 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Customers | 20 | 75 | 200 | 400 | 700 | 1,000 |
| MRR | €4k | €15k | €50k | €120k | €250k | €400k |
| ARR | €48k | €180k | €600k | €1.4M | €3M | €4.8M |
| Churn | - | 5% | 4% | 3% | 3% | 3% |

### Cost Structure (Monthly)
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Engineering (10 people) | €80-120k |
| Sales (3-5 people) | €30-50k |
| Infrastructure | €5-10k |
| Marketing | €10-20k |
| **Total Burn** | **€125-200k/month** |

### Break-even Timeline
- At €150k/month burn → Break-even at ~€200k MRR → Q4 2026
- Profitable by Q1 2027 if execution is solid

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| CBAM deadline delayed again | Low (20%) | Medium | Already delayed once, unlikely again. DPP provides backup. |
| Greenly/CarbonChain launch SME tier | Medium (40%) | High | First-mover advantage, lower price point, better UX |
| Customer acquisition slower than expected | Medium (35%) | Medium | Partner with customs brokers who MUST offer solution |
| Technical complexity higher than expected | Medium (30%) | Medium | Start with default values, add verified values later |
| Regulatory requirements change | Low (15%) | Medium | Flexible architecture, stay close to regulators |

---

## Summary: Why CBAM Beats the Others

1. **Timing:** CBAM deadline is NOW (Jan 2026). DPP is Feb 2027. CRA is Sept 2026. CBAM wins on urgency.

2. **Market Readiness:** CBAM requirements are 100% finalized. AI Act standards still evolving. DPP delegated acts still coming.

3. **Your Fit:** Steel, aluminum, cement are construction materials. You know the supply chain from Heijmans.

4. **Competition Gap:** Greenly raised €78M but only serves enterprises. No good SME solution exists.

5. **Expansion Path:** CBAM → DPP is natural (same customers, same supply chain data, same sustainability theme).

6. **Revenue Potential:** €10-50/tonne penalty means companies will pay €2-10k/year happily for compliance.

**Next Action:** Want me to create a full PRD for the CBAM platform, or would you prefer to explore one of the other opportunities in more detail first?
