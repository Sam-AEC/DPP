# Digital Product Passport SaaS for SMEs: Business Case Research

**The battery passport deadline is February 18, 2027—not January 2026—giving you 14 months to launch a minimum viable product targeting the severely underserved SME market.** Research confirms a clear market gap: enterprise DPP solutions cost €50,000-500,000+, yet **only 17% of small SMEs** share standardized digital product data and **only 16% of business managers** feel prepared for compliance. The DPP market is projected to grow from $186M (2024) to **$1.78B by 2030** at 45.7% CAGR, with batteries as the first regulated category.

---

## Phase 1: Regulatory reality reveals a later but certain deadline

### ESPR framework establishes DPP architecture

The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (EU) 2024/1781 entered into force on **July 18, 2024**, establishing the framework for all Digital Product Passports. Article 9-15 defines DPP general principles, but **product-specific requirements will come via delegated acts**—the first expected mid-2027 for iron/steel and textiles.

**What ESPR defines now:**
- DPP must be "accessible via electronic means through a data carrier" (Article 2(28))
- Must use open standards with machine-readable, structured data (Article 10(d))
- Unique identifier compliant with ISO/IEC 15459 required (Annex III)
- QR code explicitly mentioned as data carrier option

**What requires delegated acts:**
- Product-specific data field requirements
- Carbon footprint methodologies per product category
- DPP service provider certification (expected end 2025)
- Conformity assessment procedures

The ESPR Working Plan (COM(2025)187, adopted April 2025) confirms the priority product timeline:

| Product Category | Delegated Act Expected | Compliance Date* |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Iron and Steel | 2026 | ~October 2027 |
| Textiles/Apparel | 2027 | ~July 2028 |
| Aluminium | 2027 | ~Late 2028 |
| Tyres | 2027 | ~Late 2028 |
| Furniture | 2028 | ~2029 |
*18-month compliance window after delegated act adoption

### Battery Regulation provides the clearest near-term opportunity

The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) is the **only regulation with finalized, near-term DPP requirements**. Published in the Official Journal on July 28, 2023, it entered into force August 17, 2023.

**Critical timeline correction:** The battery passport requirement applies from **February 18, 2027**—not January 2026. The January/February 2026 dates relate to labeling requirements and carbon footprint declarations for industrial batteries. This gives you **14 months from today** to launch.

**Battery passport scope (Article 77):**
- LMT batteries (e-bikes, e-scooters)
- Industrial batteries with capacity **>2 kWh**
- Electric vehicle batteries

**Annex XIII specifies four data access tiers:**

| Access Level | Data Elements | Who Can Access |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Public** | Manufacturer, model, capacity, weight, carbon footprint, recycled content, expected lifetime, hazardous substances | Anyone via QR code |
| **Authorized operators** | Detailed composition, full technical specs, conformity documentation | Distributors, repairers |
| **Authorities only** | Test reports, detailed compliance verification | Market surveillance, notified bodies |
| **Legitimate interest** | State of health, remaining capacity, dismantling info, safety measures | Recyclers, second-life operators |

**QR code requirements (Article 13(6)):** Must comply with ISO/IEC 18004:2015, be "printed or engraved visibly, legibly and indelibly on the battery," and link to the battery passport.

**Primary compliance obligation:** The economic operator placing the battery on the EU market for the first time holds responsibility for passport accuracy. This includes manufacturers, importers, and distributors—with importers being the most common SME category.

---

## Phase 2: Batteries emerge as the optimal wedge

### Comparative analysis confirms battery passport priority

Scoring each potential wedge on seven factors (1-5 scale, higher is better):

| Factor | Batteries | Textiles | Electronics/ICT |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Deadline urgency** | 5 (Feb 2027) | 2 (~July 2028) | 1 (No timeline) |
| **Clarity of requirements** | 5 (Annex XIII finalized) | 2 (Delegated act pending) | 1 (Not in working plan) |
| **SMEs affected** | 4 (Importers, assemblers) | 5 (Massive) | 3 (Moderate) |
| **Willingness to pay evidence** | 4 ($10/passport benchmark) | 2 (Unknown) | 2 (Unknown) |
| **MVP data complexity** | 4 (Structured, known fields) | 2 (Supply chain tracing) | 2 (Undefined) |
| **Incumbent solution risk** | 3 (Enterprise-focused) | 2 (Fashion platforms) | 3 (ERP modules) |
| **Integration burden** | 4 (Excel import viable) | 3 (Supply chain complexity) | 3 (Multiple systems) |
| **TOTAL** | **29** | **18** | **15** |

**Batteries win decisively** due to the imminent, well-defined deadline. Textiles have massive SME volume but requirements won't solidify until 2027 at earliest. Electronics/ICT is explicitly **not in the first ESPR Working Plan**—no delegated act timeline exists.

### Battery market sizing for SME segment

The Dutch battery market includes several SME-heavy segments:
- **Home energy storage installers** (e.g., Holland Solar, SBFN members installing residential batteries >2kWh)
- **Industrial battery importers/distributors** (registered with Stichting OPEN)
- **E-bike/LMT battery importers** (significant volume in cycling-heavy Netherlands)
- **Battery pack assemblers** for industrial equipment

**UNKNOWN - needs verification:** Exact count of Dutch SMEs requiring battery passports. Stichting OPEN (the Producer Responsibility Organization for batteries) maintains registration data that could provide this.

---

## Phase 3: Competition leaves a clear SME gap

### Enterprise solutions are prohibitively expensive

The market divides into four buckets with distinct characteristics:

**Enterprise PLM/ERP (SAP, Siemens):** SAP's Digital Battery Passport requires existing SAP S/4HANA infrastructure. Claims to provide "80% of required DPP data" via Siemens partnership. Typical implementations cost **€100,000-500,000+**. Siemens Xcelerator targets large manufacturers with Teamcenter PLM. **SME gap: Prohibitive cost, requires existing ecosystem.**

**DPP specialist startups:**
- **Circularise (Netherlands):** €11M Series A, blockchain-based, serves Porsche, Audi, Philips. Explicitly targets "large OEMs, battery manufacturers" as entry points. Enterprise-focused.
- **Circulor (UK):** Delivered world's first production-scale battery passport with Volvo EX90 (June 2024). **Key pricing benchmark: ~$10 per car.** Has 145+ suppliers on platform, 2.5B+ data points. Five-year implementation timeline with Volvo.
- **Spherity (Germany):** First Catena-X certified Battery Passport. eIDAS 2.0 EU Business Wallet integration.

**Industry consortiums (not competitors—standards setters):**
- **Global Battery Alliance:** 170+ members including Tesla, BMW, CATL. Sets GHG rulebook and performance indicators but **does not sell software**.
- **Catena-X:** Automotive data ecosystem, complex onboarding designed for OEMs and tier-1 suppliers.

**Consultancies:** Big 4 DPP engagements cost **€50,000-500,000+** for strategy and implementation support.

### Quantified evidence of SME unpreparedness

German IW Institute Survey (2024):
- Only **17% of SMEs (<50 employees)** share digital product data in standardized form
- Vs **39% of companies >250 employees**

GS1 UK Research (2024):
- Only **16% of managers** believe they are fully prepared for DPP
- **79% concerned** about being blocked from EU trade
- **31% cite non-survival** if blocked from EU market access
- Top barriers: data standardization (36%), high implementation costs (31%), technical complexity (28%)

UK businesses estimate **£1.5M annual revenue loss** on average from non-compliance.

### The white space: self-service SaaS under €20K/year

Current solutions target enterprises at €50,000+. SMEs need:
- **Entry pricing <€500/month** (research suggests <€200/month ideal)
- **Excel data import** to meet them where they are
- **Template-based workflows** vs custom implementations
- **Quick deployment** (weeks not years)
- **Per-passport pricing option** for low-volume operators

Comparable compliance SaaS benchmarks: GDPR tools €1,000-50,000/year for SMEs; ISO compliance tools €5,000-15,000/year; accounting software (Visma eAccounting) €25/month.

## Key risks and mitigation strategies

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Delegated acts change requirements** | Medium | High | Build flexible JSONB schema; monitor CIRPASS/JTC 24 updates |
| **CEN/CENELEC standards incompatible** | Low | Medium | Standards expected end 2025; build on GS1/schema.org foundation |
| **Enterprise players launch SME tiers** | Medium | High | First-mover advantage; build community/referral network |
| **February 2027 deadline delayed** | Low | Medium | Broader ESPR rollout provides expansion opportunities |
| **GS1 partnership required for compliance** | Low | Medium | Register with GS1 NL early; factor into pricing if needed |
| **Customer acquisition slower than expected** | Medium | Medium | Low burn rate (€60-125/month infrastructure); consulting as bridge revenue |

---

## Conclusion: A narrow but validated opportunity

The research validates batteries as the optimal wedge for a DPP SaaS targeting SMEs. **The February 2027 deadline is 14 months away**—tight but feasible for an MVP. The market gap is quantified: enterprise solutions cost 100-500x what SMEs can afford, yet 84% of businesses feel unprepared.

**Three factors make this opportunity time-sensitive:**
1. First-mover advantage in the SME segment before enterprise players launch downmarket offerings
2. Network effects from early customer relationships with industry associations (Stichting OPEN, GS1 NL)
3. Pre-deadline urgency will peak in mid-2026 when companies realize compliance is imminent

**Recommended immediate actions:**
1. Register with GS1 Netherlands to understand standards and explore partnership
2. Contact Stichting OPEN to introduce solution and access member communications
3. Apply for MIT Knowledge Voucher (€3,750) to fund pilot with early adopters
4. Build MVP focused on battery passport data entry, QR generation, and public viewer page
5. Target pricing at €99-299/month entry tier or €5-15/passport for low-volume operators

The technical stack recommendation (Next.js + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Supabase) can be deployed within the 10-14h/week maintenance budget after initial development. Total infrastructure costs of €60-125/month keep burn rate minimal during customer acquisition.

**FACTS vs ASSUMPTIONS summary:**

**Verified facts:**
- Battery passport mandatory February 18, 2027 (EUR-Lex 2023/1542 Article 96)
- Only 16-17% of SMEs prepared (GS1 UK, German IW surveys)
- Circulor charges ~$10/passport for Volvo (Reuters interview)
- DPP market projected $186M→$1.78B by 2030 at 45.7% CAGR (MarketsandMarkets)

**Key assumptions requiring validation:**
- Number of Dutch SMEs requiring battery passports (verify with Stichting OPEN data)
- SME willingness to pay €99-299/month (validate through customer discovery)
- Accountant channel effectiveness (test through pilot partnerships)
- Competitors won't launch SME tiers before February 2027 (monitor market)
